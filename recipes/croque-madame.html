    <p>This recipe is a favorite in my family! I take a French class and I bring these little sandwiches to the French meeting. This typical French delectable is always on the menu in little French cafes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 thick slices white bread</li>
        <li>2 slices ham</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Mix in the cheese once it is melted. Dip each slice of bread into the melted cheese, coating both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Place one slice of bread into the skillet and top with 2 slices of ham. Place the second piece of bread on top. Fry until golden on each side, then remove from the skillet and set aside.        </li>
        <li>Fry the egg in the hot skillet to your liking: easy, medium, or well done. Place the fried egg on top of the sandwich and serve.</li>
